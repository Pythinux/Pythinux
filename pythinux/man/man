NAME
    man - viewer for built-in manuals
DESCRIPTION
    To quote the film WarGames, "The more complicated [computer systems] are, the more they have to help you out". 
    This was the case 40 years ago and it's still the case today. 
    MAN is a program that is used to view the various built-in 'manpages' included with Pythinux.  
MANPAGES
    Every manpage is formatted identically, and is split up into "sections".
    There are several standard sections (and even required ones), but a good example would be the `alias` man page or the `area` man page.
    The one exception to this rule is the `pydoc` manual, which is generated automatically using Python's pydoc module.

    man
        Displays this manual.
