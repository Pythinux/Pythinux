NAME
    List of built-in libraries
DESCRIPTION
    Libraries are pieces of code that can be imported and called by programs. This manpage serves as a list of the libraries built into Pythinux.
    Do note that some user-facing programs (such as AREA) may have libraries as well, and are not listed here. To find out if a built-in program can be used as a library, open the manpage and check if there is a LIBRARY section.
LIST
    libconfig
        Create INI configuration files and manage them.
    libsemver
        Deals with semantic version strings.
EXTERNAL
    There are loads of external libraries, including some official ones (see `lib.2`). 
    To install an external libary:

    $ pkm install <libary>

    Generally, package names for libraries start with 'lib', and can be searched for like so:

    $ pkm search lib

    These libraries generally do not have documentation, but a simple look at the source code (using `viewsrc`) can help.
