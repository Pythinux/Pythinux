NAME
    calc - perform arithmetic calculations
DESCRIPTION
    CALC is a tool used to perform basic arithmetic. It uses the kernel's doCalc() function, which heavily sanitises the input and passes it to python's eval().
SYNTAX
    calc <arithmetic operation>
EXAMPLES
    calc 2+2
        Performs 2 plus 2.
    calc 2/2
        Performs 2 divided by 2.
    calc 2//2
        Throws an error as doCalc() doesn't support // (integer division).
OPERATORS
    doCalc() supports a very limited amount of operators. Specifically, it supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` as well as brackets (`()`).
    Order of operations (BIDMAS, BODMAS, etc.) is respected.
    It does not support power operations (`^`), modulus (`%`), int division (`//`), or ANY other operation.
    This is a result of doCalc()'s extreme approach to safety, because Python's eval() is dangerous.
