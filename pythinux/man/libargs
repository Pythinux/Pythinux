NAME
    libargs - argparse made easier
DESCRIPTION
    You can use argparse with Pythinux, however it is a little more involved and isn't a drop-in replacement. LIBARGS provides a simpler way to do it.
LIBRARY
    libargs.ArgumentParser
        A subclass of argparse.ArgumentParser that tweaks its behaviour to make it more suitable for use in Pythinux.
        For example, it forces you to provide a program name, and forces you to pass args to parse_args().
