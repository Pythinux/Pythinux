NAME
    How to import libraries into Pythinux programs
DESCRIPTION
    Some programs (almost all, as of Pythinux 3), have built-in functions that are designed to be called by user programs.
    This manpage serves as a quick tutorial on how to import libraries into your program.
IMPORTING
    Importing a program is simple. For example, to import `libargs`, simply add the following code to the top of your program (NOT in main() or any other function):

    libargs = load_program("libargs", currentUser, libMode=True)

    This will import `libargs` (or any program for that matter) as a library, and, if it's properly implemented, no text will be printed to the terminal.
