NAME
    How to import libraries into Pythinux programs
DESCRIPTION
    Some programs (almost all, as of Pythinux 3), have built-in functions that are designed to be called by user programs.
    This manpage serves as a quick tutorial on how to import libraries into your program.
IMPORTING
    Importing a program is simple. For example, to import `libargs`, a common thing to import, simply call:

    libargs = load_program("libargs", currentUser)
TERMINAL OUTPUT
    That's it! You're done. However, because this function is designed to load programs, as the name suggets, some programs may display text when they're imported.
    The way to deal with that is `libsilent` (see `libsilent`), which is a built-in libary (see `lib`) that allows you to silence the terminal and then un-silence it:

    libsilent = load_program("libsilent", currentUser)
    stdout = libsilent.silence()
    ## Perform whatever import code you need to Perform
    libsilent.unsilence(stdout)
