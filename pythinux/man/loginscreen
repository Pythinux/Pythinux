The login screen is a complex function that retrieves the user from the user list if the authentication checks are passed.
* The user list is retrieved on startup
* The username and password is entered
* The username is verified to exist
    * If it does not, it fails
* The password hash is retrieved and decoded. If it matches, the retrieved user is logged in by passing that user object to init().
