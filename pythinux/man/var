NAME
    var - Manage environment variables
DESCRIPTION
    Environment variables are temporary data values applicable to all users that can be accessed by any program.
    They are commonly used as an alternative to config files (see libconfig).
    var is a command and library for managing environment variables.
SYNTAX
    var list
        Lists all assigned variables.
    var set <variable> <value>
        Creates a new variable and sets its value.
        Overwrites an old variable if it exists.
    var get <variable>
        Prints the value of a variable.
    var rm <variable>
        Removes a variable. Fails safely if unable to remove a variable.
EXAMPLE
    var set SHELL_ALLOW_EXIT true
        Sets "SHELL_ALLOW_EXIT" to "true". 
        Running this command enables the ability to exit Pythinux by running "exit".
    var get SHELL_ALLOW_EXIT
        Prints the value of SHELL_ALLOW_EXIT.
    var rm foo
        Removes the variable "foo" if it exists.
LIBRARY
    var.list()
        Prints all variables. NOTE: To access the list, run "giveVars()".
    var.set(var, value)
        Sets var to value.
    var.get(var, fallback="")
        Returns the value of var (as a string).
        If var doesn't exist, return fallback.
    var.getint(var, fallback=0)
        Returns the value of var (as an int).
        If var doesn't exist or isn't valid, return fallback.
    var.getbool(var, fallback=True)
        Returns True if the value of var is "true", "True", "yes", "Yes", or "1", and False for all other values.
        If var doesn't exist or isn't valid, return fallback.
    var.rm(var)
        Deletes a variable.
