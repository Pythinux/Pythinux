When you start up, the following things happen:
* The kernel is initialised
    * The kernel is the main pythinux.py file
* The login screen displays
    * See the manual titled "loginscreen" for more info
* The user is logged in
    * The user list is retrieved from config/users.cfg
    * Their user object is retrieved and the command "initd --init" is run.
    * This initialises the OS and loads the terminal by default.
* Your startup programs (normally your terminal emulator) are run.
