    installd - installation daemon
DESCRIPTION
    INSTALLD is the backend used by pkm to install packages. It reads the INI config and parses it, performing relevant actions.
SYNTAX
    installd <path/to/program.szip4>
        Installs an SZIP4 package.
LIBRARY
    installd.installd(fileName: str, yesMode=False, forceMode=False)
        Installs an SZIP4 package.
        fileName is a path to an SZIP4 package.
        if yesMode is true, the install confirmation dialogue is skipped.
        if forceMode is true, the program will still install the package if it is already installed.
        NOTE: fileName is not passed into file.evalDir(), you need to do that yourself.
