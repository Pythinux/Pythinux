NAME
    List of official external libraries
DESCRIPTION
    Pythinux has a rule: only use the standard library. That rule was only broken once, and it was by accident due to a lack of knowledge. 
    As such, sometimes libraries that should be included by default but cannot be because of the above rule are written. This is a list of those libaries.
    These libaries are maintained by the Pythinux team, and can be installed using `pkm install <name>`. 
LIST
    libactivelog
        Simultaneously prints to the terminal and saves to a file.
    libactivepath
        Advanced directory creation that takes into account recursiveness as well as paths existing, meaning you don't have to.
    libcrypto
        Generate public/private keys and use them to encrypt and decrypt data. Also has functions for pickling and unpickling.
    libjajl
        Run JAJL scripts.
    libtime
        Prints the time in a standardised format.
