NAME
    libmanparse - Parse manpages in a computer-friendly format
DESCRIPTION
    Manpages are used in Pythinux a lot, but they're in a format that kind of hard to work with. This library helps with that. It separates manpages into a structure with Manpages containing Sections and Elements. 
LIBRARY
    libmanparse.parseManpage(manpage)
        Parses a manpage and returns a Manpage class.
    libmanparse.Manpage
        Manpage class. Contains sections and elements.
        libmanparse.Manpage.add(section)
            Adds a Section to a Manpage.
        libmanparse.Manpage.flatten()
            The typical structure is manpage containing sections containing elements. This method returns sections and elements in a flat list, which can make parsing it easier in some contexts.
    libmanparse.Section
        Section class. Contains a number of Element instances.
        libmanparse.Section.
    libmanparse.SubSection(Section)
        Subclass of Section for dealing with sections in sections.
