NAME
	Changelog for Pythinux 3.2

SUMMARY
	Release 3.2 builds upon the changes made in 3.1, continuing with the small
	but not insignificant innovations. From true output redirection to support
	for device files, this is a release developers and users alike should pay
	attention to.

LIBMANPARSE
	This is a new library that can parse manpages. While this sounds
	insignificant, this allows for converting manpages into other formats,
	such as Markdown. This will make documentation much easier.

DEBUG API
	An API for debugging has been implemented. Of course, this comes with
	several security considerations. For instance, only debuggers can grant or
	revoke debugging permissions to a program. To solve the inevitable
	chicken-and-egg problem, a new program called debugmgr is used to manage
	debuggers. It can add and remove debuggers, and that's all it does.
	Official debugging tools will be released, but they won't be bundled with
	the OS for good reasons. 

	On top of this, adding a debugger causes the user to be prompted with a
	message detailing what this means and why you shouldn't add debuggers if
	you don't intend to do so.

	Finally, only debuggers are allowed to load another debugger, to avoid
	debug API theft.

OUTPUT REDIRECTION 
	Finally, output redirection. You can now redirect the output of commands
	into files using >, or even commands into other commands with |, however,
	the latter needs to be supported by the program receiving the data.
	Another limitation of piping is that it doesn't allow chaining the output.
	This will be fixed in a future release.

DEVICE FILES 
	The /dev/null, /dev/random, and /dev/urandom files are now usable! You can
	try them right now - /dev/random uses random to generate random bytes
	whereas /dev/urandom uses secrets.

SECURITY
	PSA-0008 is a recently patched critical security flaw that allowed one to
	bypass the ReadOnlyWrapper and gain access to raw function data, allowing
	for something similar to PSA-0004 to be achieved.

MISCELLANEOUS
	* The new file.listdir() function is a replacement for os.listdir() that
	includes device files.

CONCLUSION
	Pythinux 3.2 adds some pretty major changes, and it (sadly) appears to be
	the last of the heavy-hitting updates we have seen since 3.0.
