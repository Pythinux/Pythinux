NAME
	Changelog for Pythinux 3.1
SUMMARY
	Release 3.1 is a release that focuses on backend tweaks that make the
	developer experience smoother. On top of this, debugging features galore
	make finding and fixing issues less painful, especially at the kernel
	level.
NEW AND UPDATED PROGRAMS
	- isroot is a new program that displays whether or not you are root.
		Essentially a frontend for isRoot().
	- The which program now has a library. 
	- The license program has been removed due to incompatibility with
		file.open() and also generally being reliant on the repo having been
		cloned in its entirety.
	- The ls command is now unprivileged.
NEW AND UPDATED LIBRARIES
	LIBARGS
		This library is an extension of argparse that is built for Pythinux.
		It should be used instead of argparse, and several commands have been
		ported already.
NEW AND UPDATED KPARAMS	
	KPARAM_ARTIFICIAL_DECRYPT_TIME	
		Disabled by default. If enabled, verifyHash() waits an arbitrary
		amount of time in order to increase security. The wait time is set by
		KPARAM_INT_ARTIFICIAL_DECRYPT_TIME, and defaults to 2.5.
	KPARAM_DEBUGGING_VERIFYHASH
		Disabled by default. If enabled, 
	KPARAM_DISABLE_CLS
		Disabled by default. If enabled, the cls() function is disabled
		systemwide.
	KPARAM_DEBUGGING_LOAD_PROGRAM
		Disabled by default. If enabled, displays comprehensive debugging info
		every time loadProgramBase() is called.
	KPARAM_REAL_DIRECTORY
		Enabled by default. If enabled, Real Directory Support(tm) is enabled.
FILE.OPEN() AND THE FUTURE OF OPEN()
	The open() function has been deprecated for removal in 3.3, to be replaced
	by file.open().
PACKAGING IMPROVEMENTS
	The Program.replaces defines a *single* program that a package can
	overwrite.
SECURITY
	PSA-0006
		This was a code injection. attack targeting the baseMode argument in 
		load_program(). The mitigation is to remove baseMode entirely.
	ASSERTIONS
		The all-new assertTrue() function (which is indeed exposed) allows a
		program to assert that a condition is met and raise an exception if it
		is not. This is used in almost all kernel functions now to ensure
		type safety. 
		NOTE: The assert keyword can be disabled with a flag passed to
			python's executable, which is why we chose to reimplement it.
REAL DIRECTORY SUPPORT
	More work on Real Directory Support is being done. However, it is still
	not a working system, however, we target a 3.3 release for when it should.
	Currently, KPARAM_REAL_DIRECTORY is implemented, as well as certain API
	functions that *should* help with making it a possibility.
MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES
	- Added a copyright header to every file. It includes ASCII art of the
		project's name, which isn't rendered correctly all the time (including,
		ironically enough, CodeBerg's file viewer).
	- Removed the sha256() kernel function. It was never exposed to programs
		and never actually used.
