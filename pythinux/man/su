NAME
    su - Launch a root shell
DESCRIPTION
    SU allows you to easily elevate to a root shell by entering your password.
    This is useful as it means you do not need to type "sudo" for potentially dozens of commands.
USAGE
    su
        Launches a root shell. Requires group priveleges (see below) as well as password-based authentication.
GROUP AUTH
    In order to use `su`, the logged-in user needs to be in a group with the `canSudo` permission enabled. The default groups `user` and `root` have the value enabled, meaning most users can do this. When creating groups, this needs considering.
