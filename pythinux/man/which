NAME
    which - find the executable path of a program
DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes, you need to grab the executable path of a script. There are many ways to do it, but WHICH is the best way, because it searches for scripts in the same order as Pythinux's program loader does, meaning it's 100% accurate.
SYNTAX
    which [list of programs]
        Searches for the file path of a program and displays it if it finds one. If not, it displays "N/A".
EXAMPLES
    which help
        Displays the file path of "help".
LIBRARY
    which.which(args)
       Finds and returns the path of a list of program names, e.g ["help"].
