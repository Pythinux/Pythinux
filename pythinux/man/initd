When you log in, initd searches for the "init.d" file in your home directory (/home/<your username>/). If it finds it, it will be executed as a script.

Logging
div()
When initd is ran, the terminal is silenced and all terminal output is sent to '/log/init.d' until the program ends. 
This means you do not see what happens during boot-up, unless you check '/log/init.d'.
