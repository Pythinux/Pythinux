Welcome to Pythinux. Pythinux is an operating system written in Python.

GETTING STARTED

First things first, you'll probably want to run some programs. Try this:

$ echo Hello, World!

Of course, that's not particularly useful, so perhaps you'd like a list of installed programs:

$ help

But the installed programs are boring, so perhaps you'd like a list of programs you can install:

$ pkm all

If a program looks interesting:

$ pkm install <name of program>

That's the package name, the all-lowercase one without spaces, NOT the full name.

SUPPORT CHANNELS

There are plenty of places to get help:

* The HELP command
    * This program lists all installed programs. It's useful for playing around.
* The MAN command
    * Pythinux has manpages! Run `man /` for a list of them, and `man <manpage>` to view help for something. Chances are, a program has a manpage to go with it as well.
* The wiki
    * https://wiki.pythinux.gordinator.org
    * It's a useful resource for both users and developers, and is kept constantly up-to-date.
* The IRC channel
    * If you have an IRC client, connect to irc.gordinator.org (port 6667 or 6697) and join #pythinux. You should find someone who can help you.
* The Git repository
    * https://codeberg.org/Pythinux/Pythinux
    * It's a good last resort.

SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

Every so often, you should run these commands:

$ pkm update
$ pkm upgrade
$ pkm dist-upgrade

This makes sure your packages and OS are up-to-date.
